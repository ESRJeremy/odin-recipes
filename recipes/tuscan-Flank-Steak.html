        <h2>Discription</h2>

        <p>
            This very user-friendly Flank Steak is the perfect cut for
            this reciepe. It is cooked over a charcoal fire, sliced thin, 
            splashed with olive oil, lemon, and finally rosemary. Its 
            may not be a traditional Tuscan Flank Steak but it is 
            very tasty none the less. I hope you enjoy.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh rosemary
            <li>6 cloves garlic
            <li>⅓ cup olive oil
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice
            <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
            <li>½ teaspoon salt
            <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, trimmed of excess fat
            <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
            <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
            <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes
            <li>1 pinch salt
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup chopped fresh rosemary, garlic, 1/3 cup olive oil, 
                1/4 cup lemon juice, black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and 
                1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and 
                set marinade aside.
            <li>Pierce the steak with a fork 20 to 30 times. Place in a shallow 
                baking dish. Pour marinade over steak and flip to coat both sides. Cover 
                and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours.
            <li>Combine 1/3 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest, 
                1 teaspoon minced rosemary, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and a pinch 
                of salt in a jar. Cover and shake the dressing to combine. Shake again 
                before using.
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            <li>Remove steak from marinade; scrape off any chunks of marinade. Discard 
                used marinade. Season steak with salt and black pepper.
            <li>Place steak on the preheated grill and cook until browned on the outside 
                and red on the inside, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place 2 tablespoons 
                of the olive oil-lemon juice dressing in a small bowl. Use rosemary sprig 
                to baste the steak while it cooks. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into the center of a steak should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for 
                rare.
            <li>Remove steak to a platter and allow to rest about 6 minutes before slicing. 
                Cut in half lengthwise, then into 1/4-inch-thick slices at an angle against 
                the grain. Drizzle with additional dressing.
